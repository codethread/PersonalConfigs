# Model Code Summary Comparison

User Sign off: codethread

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to evaluate the effectiveness of different Claude models (Haiku, Opus, Sonnet) at generating code documentation summaries to determine if the more economical Haiku model provides sufficient quality for this task. The hypothesis is that Haiku will be adequate for code summarization tasks, potentially offering cost savings without sacrificing quality.

## Value Statement

- **Cost Optimization**: If Haiku proves sufficient, significant cost savings can be achieved for documentation generation tasks
- **Quality Baseline**: Establish empirical evidence for model selection in code documentation workflows
- **Decision Framework**: Create data-driven approach for selecting appropriate models for different documentation tasks

## Stakeholders

- **Users**: Developers using automated documentation generation
- **Maintainers**: Team responsible for maintaining documentation agents
- **Dependencies**: Documentation workflow automation systems

## Technical Architecture

The evaluation will use three identical documentation generator agents with different underlying models:

- `documentation-generator-haiku` (Claude Haiku model)
- `documentation-generator-opus` (Claude Opus model)
- `documentation-generator-sonnet` (Claude Sonnet model)

Each agent will process the same set of files and generate one-line documentation comments.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: File Selection

The system SHALL select a representative sample of files from:

- Lua files from `/Users/codethread/PersonalConfigs/config/nvim/`
  - config/nvim/lua/plugins/lore.lua
  - config/nvim/lua/codethread/gx.lua
  - config/nvim/lua/codethread/tbl_align.lua
- Nushell files from `/Users/codethread/PersonalConfigs/config/nushell/`
  - config/nushell/scripts/ct/dotty/config.nu
  - config/nushell/scripts/ct/cursor/mod.nu
  - config/nushell/scripts/ct/alias/git.nu
- TypeScript files from `/Users/codethread/PersonalConfigs/oven/bin/`
  - oven/bin/bra.ts
  - oven/bin/extract-commit-dialogue.ts
  - oven/bin/gmr.ts

### FR-2: Agent Testing

The system SHALL:

- Process each selected file through all three documentation agents
- Capture the generated documentation for each model
- Ensure identical input conditions for each test

### FR-3: Results Capture

The system SHALL:

- Use git to identify changes made by each agent
- Record the exact documentation generated
- Revert changes between each agent test to ensure clean state

### FR-4: Comparative Analysis

The system SHALL produce a comparison that evaluates:

- Accuracy of the documentation relative to code functionality
- Completeness of information captured
- Clarity and readability of generated summaries
- Conciseness while maintaining informativeness

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Test Consistency

Each model SHALL receive identical input files and processing conditions to ensure fair comparison

### NFR-2: Reproducibility

The test methodology SHALL be documented to allow reproduction of results

### NFR-3: Objectivity

The evaluation SHALL use specific criteria rather than subjective preferences

## External Dependencies

- Git for tracking and reverting changes
- Three documentation generator agents with different models
- Access to codebase files in specified directories

## Interface Definitions

Agent invocation will use the Task tool with:

- `subagent_type`: documentation-generator-[haiku|opus|sonnet]
- `prompt`: File path(s) to document
- `description`: "Generate documentation for [language] files"

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ At least 3 files from each language (9 total) are tested
2. ✅ All three models process identical file sets
3. ✅ Documentation is captured for each model/file combination
4. ✅ Comparative analysis includes specific examples
5. ✅ Clear recommendation is provided based on evidence
6. ✅ Cost-benefit analysis is included in findings

## Implementation Notes

- Files should be diverse in complexity (simple utilities, complex logic, configuration)
- Consider file size variations (small, medium, large files)
- Document any edge cases or model failures
- Track processing time if significantly different

## Technical Debt Tracking

None identified for this evaluation task.
