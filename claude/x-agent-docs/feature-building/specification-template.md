## Context and Problem Statement

[Clear description of the business problem and why this feature is needed]

## Value Statement

[Expected outcomes and success metrics]

## Stakeholders

- **Users**: [Who will use this]
- **Maintainers**: [Who will maintain this]
- **Dependencies**: [Other systems/teams affected]

## Technical Architecture

[High-level design decisions, component boundaries, integration points]

## Functional Requirements

### 1. [Feature Category]

- [ ] 1.1 [Specific testable requirement with acceptance criteria]
- [ ] 1.2 [Another requirement with measurable outcome]

### 2. [Another Category]

- [ ] 2.1 [Requirement with clear pass/fail criteria]

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- [ ] Response time < 200ms for 95% of requests
- [ ] Support 10K concurrent users

### Security

- [ ] Authentication via JWT
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints

### Error Handling

- [ ] Graceful degradation for external service failures
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging

## External Dependencies

<!-- CRITICAL: Complete pre-flight validation checklist from .claude/agent-docs/writing-specs.md -->

[List all external tools, APIs, libraries with versions and validated behaviors]

## Interface Definitions

[API endpoints, data models, integration contracts]

```typescript
// Example interface
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

// Example API endpoint
POST /api/users
Body: { email: string, password: string }
Response: { token: string, user: UserProfile }
```

## Acceptance Criteria

[Clear conditions that determine feature completion]

1. All functional requirements pass QA verification
2. Performance benchmarks met under load testing
3. Security audit completed with no critical issues
4. Documentation updated for all new APIs

## Implementation Notes

[Technical constraints, dependencies, risks]

- Depends on authentication service v2.0+
- Must be backward compatible with existing API
- Consider rate limiting implementation options

## Technical Debt Tracking

[Document any shortcuts taken or areas needing future attention]

- [ ] Refactor authentication logic after v3.0 release
- [ ] Optimize database queries for better performance
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests
