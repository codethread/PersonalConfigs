# Creating Effective System Prompts for Claude Code's Multi-Agent Architecture

## Claude Code's subagent feature enables powerful multi-agent architectures

Claude Code's subagent system allows you to create specialized AI assistants that operate with isolated context windows, custom system prompts, and configurable tool access. Subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `.claude/agents/` (project-level) or `~/.claude/agents/` (user-level). The system supports both automatic delegation based on task context and explicit invocation through commands, enabling sophisticated orchestration patterns where a primary architect agent manages specialized implementation teams.

## The architect agent: Your AI CTO

The primary architect agent should embody the strategic thinking and technical oversight of a CTO or chief architect role. This agent focuses on high-level system design, requirement analysis, and coordinating specialized subagents rather than implementing details directly.

### Core Architect Agent System Prompt Template

```markdown
---
name: system-architect
description: Primary architect agent for system design, specification, and delegation
tools: # Inherits all tools - needs access to coordinate other agents
---

You are a senior system architect with 15+ years of experience in distributed systems design. Your role is to serve as the technical leadership layer, translating user requirements into comprehensive specifications and coordinating specialized subagents for implementation.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Engage in detailed discussions with users to understand functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and success criteria
2. **System Design**: Create architectural specifications with clear component boundaries, interfaces, and integration points
3. **Task Decomposition**: Break down complex systems into manageable, implementable tasks suitable for delegation
4. **Delegation Management**: Assign tasks to specialized subagents based on their capabilities and monitor progress
5. **Quality Oversight**: Maintain architectural coherence without micromanaging implementation details

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Discovery and Specification

- Conduct thorough requirements gathering through iterative discussion
- Identify stakeholders, constraints, and success metrics
- Document user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- Create high-level architectural diagrams and component maps

### Phase 2: Technical Planning

- Generate detailed technical specifications for each component
- Define interfaces, data contracts, and integration patterns
- Identify technology stack requirements and dependencies
- Create task breakdown structure with clear boundaries

### Phase 3: Delegation and Coordination

When delegating to subagents, provide:

- **Context**: Full background and architectural intent
- **Specification**: Detailed requirements and constraints
- **Deliverables**: Expected outputs and quality standards
- **Integration Points**: How their work fits the larger system

### Phase 4: Synthesis and Validation

- Review outputs from subagents for architectural compliance
- Ensure integration points align correctly
- Validate against original requirements
- Provide feedback and request iterations when needed

## Delegation Guidelines

For each task, evaluate:

- Can this be handled by a specialized subagent?
- What context does the subagent need to succeed?
- How will the output integrate with other components?
- What quality checks should be applied?

Invoke subagents using explicit commands:

> Use the code-implementation subagent to implement the user authentication module according to specification A.2.1
> Use the qa-analyst subagent to create test cases for the payment processing workflow
> Use the research-specialist subagent to investigate optimal database choices for our real-time analytics requirements

## Output Standards

Always structure architectural decisions using:

- **Context**: Current situation and constraints
- **Analysis**: Options with trade-offs (cost, complexity, performance, maintainability)
- **Recommendation**: Specific guidance with clear justification
- **Specification**: Detailed requirements for implementation
- **Next Steps**: Concrete actions and delegation plan
```

## Specialized subagent design patterns

Each specialized subagent should have a focused role with clear boundaries and specific expertise. The key is creating agents that excel at their specific domain while understanding how their work integrates into the larger system.

## Effective delegation patterns in Claude Code

The key to successful multi-agent orchestration in Claude Code is establishing clear communication protocols and maintaining architectural coherence while allowing subagents to operate independently.

### Task Specification Format

When the architect agent delegates to subagents, use this structured format:

```yaml
Task_Specification:
  id: "auth-module-implementation"
  type: "coding"
  priority: "high"

  context:
    background: "User authentication system for SaaS platform"
    architectural_decision: "JWT-based stateless authentication"
    constraints: "Must support 10K concurrent users, GDPR compliant"

  requirements:
    functional:
      - "Email/password authentication"
      - "OAuth2 integration (Google, GitHub)"
      - "Multi-factor authentication support"
    non_functional:
      - "Response time < 200ms"
      - "Token refresh without user interaction"
      - "Audit logging for all auth events"

  technical_specification:
    interfaces:
      - "POST /api/auth/login"
      - "POST /api/auth/refresh"
      - "POST /api/auth/logout"
    data_models:
      - "User entity with encrypted password"
      - "Session tracking for security"
    dependencies:
      - "Redis for session storage"
      - "PostgreSQL for user data"

  deliverables:
    - "Complete implementation files"
    - "Unit tests with >80% coverage"
    - "Integration documentation"
    - "Security considerations document"

  success_criteria:
    - "All endpoints functioning correctly"
    - "Tests passing"
    - "Performance benchmarks met"
    - "Security review passed"
```

### Invocation Patterns

The architect agent can use different delegation patterns based on task complexity:

**Sequential Delegation**: For dependent tasks

```
> First use the research-specialist subagent to evaluate caching strategies for our requirements
> Then use the code-implementation subagent to implement the chosen caching solution
> Finally use the qa-analyst subagent to validate the implementation
```

**Parallel Delegation**: For independent components

```
> Use the code-implementation subagent to build the authentication module
> Simultaneously use another code-implementation instance for the payment module
> Use the qa-analyst subagent to create test suites for both modules
```

**Iterative Refinement**: For complex features

```
> Use the code-implementation subagent to create initial implementation
> Use the qa-analyst subagent to identify issues
> Use the code-implementation subagent to address identified problems
> Repeat until quality standards are met
```

## Maintaining architectural oversight

The architect agent maintains system coherence through several oversight mechanisms that avoid micromanagement while ensuring quality.

### Quality Gates Without Micromanagement

**Checkpoint Reviews**: Define clear milestones where the architect reviews progress:

- After specification completion
- Post-implementation but pre-integration
- Following QA analysis
- Before production deployment

**Automated Validation**: Use quality gates that subagents must pass:

```python
quality_criteria = {
    'code_coverage': 0.80,
    'performance_threshold': 200,  # ms
    'security_score': 'A',
    'documentation_complete': True
}
```

**Specification Compliance**: The architect validates outputs against original specifications:

- Interface contracts are met exactly
- Data models match definitions
- Performance requirements satisfied
- Security constraints implemented

### Context Management Strategies

**Progressive Context Filtering**: Provide appropriate context without overwhelming subagents:

- High-level overview for all agents
- Detailed specifications for implementation agents
- Test requirements for QA agents
- Technology constraints for research agents

**State Preservation**: Maintain architectural decisions across delegations:

```markdown
## Architectural Context (Preserved Across All Tasks)

- Microservices architecture with REST APIs
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Docker/Kubernetes deployment
- JWT-based authentication
- Event-driven communication via RabbitMQ
```

## Claude Code specific features and syntax

Claude Code provides several features that enable effective multi-agent architectures:

### File Structure Organization

```
project/
├── .claude/
│   └── agents/
│       ├── system-architect.md      # Primary architect agent
│       ├── code-implementation.md   # Coding specialist
│       ├── qa-analyst.md           # QA specialist
│       └── research-specialist.md  # Research agent
├── specifications/
│   ├── system-architecture.md
│   └── component-specs/
└── src/
```

### Agent Management Commands

**Interactive Management**: Use `/agents` command for:

- Creating new subagents with guided setup
- Editing existing agent prompts and permissions
- Viewing all available subagents
- Testing agent invocations

**Direct File Creation**: For version control:

```bash
# Create a new specialized agent
cat > .claude/agents/database-specialist.md << 'EOF'
---
name: database-specialist
description: Database design and optimization expert
tools: Read, Write, Bash
---

You are a database architecture specialist...
EOF
```

### Tool Access Configuration

**Granular Permissions**: Limit subagent tools for security:

```yaml
# Research agent - read-only access
tools: web_search, web_fetch, Read

# Implementation agent - full development access
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob

# QA agent - testing tools only
tools: Read, Bash
```

**MCP Integration**: Subagents can access Model Context Protocol servers:

```yaml
tools: mcp_github, mcp_postgres, mcp_slack
```

## Real-world implementation example

Here's a complete example of implementing a user management system using the multi-agent architecture:

### Step 1: Architect Agent Creates Specification

The architect engages with the user to understand requirements, then creates:

```markdown
## User Management System Specification

### Functional Requirements

- User registration with email verification
- Role-based access control (Admin, User, Guest)
- Profile management with avatar upload
- Password reset via email
- Activity audit logging

### Technical Architecture

- RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
- PostgreSQL for user data
- Redis for session management
- S3 for avatar storage
- SendGrid for email delivery

### Component Breakdown

1. Authentication Service (auth-service)
2. User Profile Service (profile-service)
3. Permission Service (permission-service)
4. Notification Service (notification-service)
```

### Step 2: Architect Delegates Implementation

```
> Use the code-implementation subagent to implement the authentication service according to the auth-service specification
> Use another code-implementation subagent to build the profile service following the profile-service specification
> Use the qa-analyst subagent to create comprehensive test suites for both services
```

### Step 3: Subagents Execute Tasks

Each subagent works independently:

- **Code Implementation Agent 1**: Builds complete auth service with JWT handling
- **Code Implementation Agent 2**: Creates profile service with S3 integration
- **QA Analyst**: Generates test cases covering all endpoints and edge cases

### Step 4: Architect Reviews and Integrates

The architect:

- Validates implementations against specifications
- Ensures services integrate correctly
- Confirms quality standards are met
- Provides feedback for any necessary iterations

### Step 5: Final Delivery

The complete system includes:

- Fully implemented services
- Comprehensive test coverage
- API documentation
- Deployment configurations
- Operational runbooks

## Best practices and recommendations

Based on research and production deployments, these practices ensure successful multi-agent implementations:

### Start Simple, Scale Gradually

1. Begin with a basic architect + one specialist agent
2. Add specialized agents as patterns become clear
3. Refine prompts based on actual usage
4. Expand to parallel execution once comfortable

### Optimize Token Usage

Multi-agent systems use approximately **15× more tokens** than single agents. Manage this through:

- Clear, concise specifications
- Filtered context passing
- Avoid redundant information
- Use summaries for long contexts

### Maintain Clear Boundaries

- Each agent should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- Avoid overlapping capabilities that cause confusion
- Create explicit handoff protocols
- Document integration points clearly

### Implement Feedback Loops

- Track agent performance metrics
- Identify common failure patterns
- Iteratively improve prompts
- Maintain a library of successful patterns

### Version Control Everything

- Store agents in `.claude/agents/` for team sharing
- Track specifications in version control
- Document architectural decisions
- Maintain change logs for agent prompts

### Error Handling Strategy

Build resilience through:

- Clear escalation paths to the architect
- Graceful degradation for failures
- Checkpoint systems for long-running tasks
- Human oversight for critical decisions

The multi-agent architecture in Claude Code enables sophisticated software development workflows that mirror real-world team structures. By carefully designing your architect agent to manage specifications and coordinate specialists, you can build complex systems efficiently while maintaining quality and architectural coherence. Start with these templates, adapt them to your specific needs, and evolve your agent ecosystem based on practical experience.
